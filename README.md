CudaCmakeExample
================
A simple cuda-cmake code for doing library stuff.


Elia A. Attardo, and Andrea Borsic (C) first create this to show how to work with cuda and cmake to produce example doing 
cuda library stuff. Refer this to the authors'website:http://www.eattardo.com/cmake-cuda-library/

Shuai Zheng (Kyle) (C) modified this code to make it correctly producing the results. The code has been tested under windows
8.1 visual studio 2012.
